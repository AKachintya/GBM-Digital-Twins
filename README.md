# GBM-Digital-Twins

This repository is a 2-week prototype for a patient-specific digital twin of glioblastoma.
The Context of Use (CoU) is: 
> "In silico modeling of GBM progression and drug response as a replacement for exploratory animal efficacy studies."

Initial goals:
- Ingest GBM MRI datasets (BraTS subset).
- Extract radiomic features.
- Link to simple molecular label (MGMT).
- Build a toy twin simulation with therapy response.
